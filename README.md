# Quiz Testing Scripts
## Description
I created a series of scripts for testing a working quiz application using Cypress. This includes scripts for both component and e2e testing. The quiz app was provided to me by Rutger's University, and this was a homework assignment that I completed for their Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.<br><br>
